# Image Segmentation using Pythonâ€™s scikit-image module

# Process of splitting images into multiple layers, represented by a smart, pixel-wise mask
# is known as Image Segmentation. It involves merging, blocking, and
# separating an image from its integration level. Splitting a picture into a collection of Image
# Objects with comparable properties is the first stage in image processing.

# Scikit-Image is the most popular tool/module for image processing in Python.
